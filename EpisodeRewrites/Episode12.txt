On this episode of News of the Galaxy we talk about how Connor says Godzilla, Jody takes on the whole internet, our guest pretends to be Nick, Connor talks the big talk, Jody comes up with the starting question, and our guest remembers most of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon theme. Jody’s mic was buzzing for most of the episode so sorry for the audio problems.

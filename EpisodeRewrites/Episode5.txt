- The Asteroid Field:
	- How will Rouge One be different than the main line story movies. Is this a opportunity for Disney to tell Star Wars stories in other film genres? (Text crawl or no, sayings like I have a bad felling about this or other Star Wars tropes).

- Palpatine’s Tip of the Week:
	- Best part: Palpatine told Nick to step in front of a bull dowser. Nick said that that was called assault. Then Palpatine told Nick that by the time he was done it would be called asphalt.

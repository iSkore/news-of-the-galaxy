On this Crazy episode of the cast you have learned to love we talk about all things Star Wars in this XL episode. We also have a new co-host (Jody) and we are happy to have him. Also this episode is episode 9 because episode 8 was recorded and then lost in the editing stage. We have got so much Star Wars in this episode that you may just go supernova. Enjoy.

This episode was recorded on 3/2/17.
